# Python Modules
This repository demonstrates the use of modules in python:
* It all started from the `exporter.py` file/module where we have functions and a variable.
* We imported it into the `importer.py` module and were able to chain our functions which 
we could now now call from `importer.py`.
* The `alias.py` file was used to demonstrate how to import a module and renaming it, using the as keyword.
* The `part.py` and `importpart.py` demonstate how we can import selected functions and a variable into
a module without importing the entire module.
* The `mydatemodule.py` shows how to work with the `datetime` module.
